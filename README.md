# Cam-Toggle-
Cleo script that fixes the issue of the screen zooming in and out automatically from the player.
Now the screen can only zoom in and out using the camera toggle button (two-finger swipe on the screen has been disabled).

Cleo button used to change position/size:
PositionAndScale 460, 115, 30, 30 ; WIDGET_POSITION_CAM_TOGGLE
